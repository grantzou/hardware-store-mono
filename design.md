## Design Document

### Overview

This document outlines the tradeoffs behind choosing specific technologies and design patterns for a web application supporting a small hardware store. The application will be built using Java 17, Spring Boot 3, REST API, and MySQL, and also leveaging JHipster to demo the very first step of a roadmap from Monolith to Microservices and EDA.

### Technologies

#### JHipster

**Pros:**

- **Rapid Development:** Provides a full-stack development platform with pre-configured tools and technologies.
- **Best Practices:** Enforces best practices in code structure, security, and performance.
- **Microservices Support:** Easily supports microservices architecture if needed in the future.

**Cons:**

- **Complexity:** Can be overwhelming for small projects due to the number of integrated tools.
- **Customization:** Customizing the generated code can be challenging and may require a deep understanding of the underlying technologies.

#### Java 17

**Pros:**

- **Long-Term Support (LTS):** Ensures stability and long-term updates.
- **Performance Improvements:** Enhanced performance and new features like pattern matching and sealed classes.
- **Security:** Regular updates and patches improve security.

**Cons:**

- **Compatibility:** Some libraries and frameworks might not yet fully support Java 17.
- **Learning Curve:** New features may require a learning curve for developers familiar with older versions.

#### Spring Boot 3

**Pros:**

- **Rapid Development:** Simplifies setup and development with auto-configuration and starter dependencies.
- **Microservices Ready:** Ideal for building microservices with embedded servers and cloud-native features.
- **Community Support:** Strong community and extensive documentation.

**Cons:**

- **Memory Consumption:** Can be resource-intensive, especially for small applications.
- **Complexity:** Auto-configuration can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, requiring deeper understanding.

#### REST API

**Pros:**

- **Statelessness:** Simplifies server design by treating each request independently.
- **Scalability:** Easily scalable due to its stateless nature.
- **Interoperability:** Widely supported across different platforms and languages.

**Cons:**

- **Overhead:** HTTP headers and response formats can introduce overhead.
- **Limited Transactions:** Statelessness can complicate transactions that span multiple requests.

#### MySQL

**Pros:**

- **Maturity:** Well-established and widely used relational database.
- **Performance:** Optimized for read-heavy operations and supports indexing.
- **Community Support:** Extensive community and documentation.

**Cons:**

- **Scalability:** Vertical scaling can be challenging; horizontal scaling requires additional tools.
- **Complex Queries:** Complex joins and queries can impact performance.

### Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern

**Use Case:** Managing a single instance of a configuration or connection pool.
**Pros:**

- **Controlled Access:** Ensures a single instance, reducing resource usage.
- **Lazy Initialization:** Can be initialized only when needed.

**Cons:**

- **Global State:** Can introduce global state, making testing and debugging harder.
- **Concurrency Issues:** Requires careful handling in multi-threaded environments.

#### Factory Pattern

**Use Case:** Creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
**Pros:**

- **Encapsulation:** Hides the creation logic from the client.
- **Flexibility:** Makes it easy to introduce new types of objects.

**Cons:**

- **Complexity:** Adds an extra layer of abstraction.
- **Maintenance:** Can become cumbersome with many product types.

#### Observer Pattern

**Use Case:** Implementing event handling systems.
**Pros:**

- **Decoupling:** Promotes loose coupling between the subject and observers.
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new observers without modifying the subject.

**Cons:**

- **Performance:** Can introduce performance overhead with many observers.
- **Complexity:** Managing dependencies and ensuring all observers are updated correctly can be complex.

### Conclusion

The choice of technologies and design patterns involves tradeoffs between performance, scalability, complexity, and ease of development. JHipster, Java 17, and Spring Boot 3 provide a robust foundation for building scalable applications, while REST APIs and MySQL offer interoperability and reliability. Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer help manage object creation and event handling, though they come with their own set of challenges.
